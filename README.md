🎓 Student Performance Prediction & Flask DeploymentThis project represents a comprehensive Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) application developed for highly accurate prediction of the Student Performance Index, a key measure reflecting academic success. The model was built using Python and Scikit-learn, and successfully deployed as an interactive web interface using the Flask framework.1. 💡 Value Proposition and End-User BenefitThis application provides users with immediate, predictive insight into academic performance:Student Perspective: Students can input their data (study hours, previous scores) to evaluate the predicted impact of their current effort on their expected performance.Educator/Researcher Perspective: The model demonstrates the importance of each factor (e.g., Previous Scores being the strongest predictor), helping to guide efforts toward the most influential variables.Ease of Use: The model is presented via a simple, clear web interface (HTML Form) instead of requiring complex Python code execution.2. 🎯 ML Methodology and PerformanceA comprehensive workflow was followed to ensure model accuracy and integrity:A. End-to-End WorkflowExploratory Analysis: Visual analysis was conducted to confirm linearity and determine the strongest predictor features.Encoding: One-Hot Encoding was applied to the categorical feature (Extracurricular activities), and a column was dropped to prevent the Dummy Variable Trap.Data Integrity: The dataset was split into Training (80%) and Testing (20%) sets to prevent Data Leakage.Standardization (Scaling): StandardScaler was applied only to the training features, and the same fitted scaler was used to transform the test set.Training & Persistence: The MLR model was trained on the prepared data, and both the model and the fitted scaler were saved using pickle.B. Performance MetricsMetricResultInterpretationR-squared ($R^2$)0.9885 (~98.85%)The model explains nearly 99% of the variance in student performance (Excellent Fit).MAE (Mean Absolute Error)1.65 pointsThe average prediction error is only 1.65 points on the performance scale.3. 📂 Project Structure and Execution GuideA.
